# portfolio-design-one
This is my first attempt at creating a responsive website for my portfolio to be showcased. 
This will be an on-going project as I continue to learn the front and back-end.

The end goal of this website is to make sure it is:
- responsive regardless of the device used to view the website
- Dynamic - over time, I will add subscribe options and blogging features that allow for users to interact too. 
- The design is likely to change over time as I become adept at UI/UX etc. 

I will be spending time refactoring because I am aware there is repition in my code in this first draft that can be reduced. 
In addition to this, I will be paying close attention to ceaning up my code once I am satisfied with the layout and design. 

I would welcome any feedback
