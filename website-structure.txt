***Version 1.0***

===LAST EDITED===
===30 NOV 2018===
1. Created Navbar with links and brand
2. created a section-wrapper height 80vh;
3. created a section-wrapper-content to house image, text, button, and hr

===NEED TO DO===
1. Figure out media query for screen size and how the text will appear - font size etc, so it does not overlap with the other sections. 
2. Next section needs to be #about-me in detail where icons of the technologies I know are shown etc. and more importantly, the know more button links to that section of the page.
